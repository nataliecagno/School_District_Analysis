# School_District_Analysis
## Purpose
Analysis focused on performance of math and reading schools of school district in preparation of board meeting. Overall precentages were analyzed across school name, school types, school sizes and average budget spending per student. 
Upon further investigation the board noted that the results for Thomas High School's 9th grade class have been fabricated. As a result, we adjusted analysis to remove those students scores and analyze data again.
